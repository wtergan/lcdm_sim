# notebooks

Package-backed teaching notebooks for the modular `lcdm_sim` pipeline.

Files:
- `01_intro_parameters.ipynb`
- `02_initial_conditions.ipynb`
- `03_cic_forces_and_diagnostics.ipynb`
- `04_full_pm_simulation.ipynb`

These notebooks import from `lcdm_sim` (via `src/`) and are intended to replace the older monolithic notebook implementations for ongoing work.
